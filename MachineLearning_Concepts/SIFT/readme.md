**Step 1: Space Construction**<br>
<ol>
  1. Take original image and perform Gaussian blur, to remove unimportant points and extra noise<br>
  2. Resize the image and repeat the process<br>
</ol>
**Step 2: Difference between the Gaussians**<br>
<ol>
  1. Take images from step 1 and find the difference between their values.<br>
  2. This makes the image scale invariant.<br>
</ol>
**Step 3: Important Points**<br>
<ol>
</ol>
**Step 4: Unimportant key points**<br>
**Step 5: Orientation of Key points**<br>
**Step 6: Key Features**<br>
